# Ciphers
Here are my self made cipher algorithms. dont expect to much im just messing around
I'll extend this in the future and try to write my own kind of cipher algorithm based on the AES256 
but these are plans for the future, dont expect to much it'll be a hassle

For now: (Maybe weekly uploads of some self copied cipher algorithms based on python (maybe java or kotlin idk))

The Caesar algorithms are about the Caesar Cipher (Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

The caesarX.py can be used for endless keys whereas the caesar(n).py can only be used for a certain number
the bruteforce isn't good, its just bruteforce you will have to look through the results by yourself

Reverse.py just writes text in reverse.. what did you expect
