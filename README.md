# Ciphers
Here are my self made cipher algorithms. dont expect too much since im just messing around.
I'll extend this in the future and try to write my own kind of cipher algorithm based on AES256,
but these are plans for the future, therefore dont expect too much, it'll be a hassle.

For now: Maybe weekly uploads of some self copied cipher algorithms based on python (maybe java or kotlin idk yet)

The Caesar algorithms are based on the [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

The caesarX.py can be used for endless keys, whereas the caesar(n).py can only be used for a certain input.
The bruteforce isn't good, cause its just generating the strings and you will have to look through them by yourself.

Reverse.py just writes text in reverse... duh

Additional note: defcaesar is the whole caesarX.py code but you can import and use the module in other python programs
import it as normal and everything should work fine
